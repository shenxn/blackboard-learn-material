# Blackboard Stylish

**This project is still under development.**

This is a [Stylish](https://userstyles.org) theme for [Blackboard Learn](https://www.blackboard.com/). The theme is developed and tested on the [Purdue University version](https://mycourses.purdue.edu/). It may or may not work on other schools' versions.

The theme is based on [Materialize 1.0.0](http://next.materializecss.com/), and uses [SCSS](http://sass-lang.com/) to generate the final CSS code.
